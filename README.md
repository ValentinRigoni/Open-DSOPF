It has been widely demonstrated that active network management (ANM) strategies will be required to avoid the violation of network      operational limits in distribution networks with a rich presence of distributed energy resources (DERs). With the characteristics of     different ANM strategies been varied, e.g. centralized or decentralized, a platform where the benefits and drawbacks of multiple approaches can be easily quantified and benchmarked is required. This work introduces an open-source python-based package with a three-phase unbalanced OPF model (written in Pyomo) that is automatically created by extracting the data available from any network modelled in OpenDSS. A real British low voltage (LV) network with domestic-scale photovoltaics is used as a test case.
